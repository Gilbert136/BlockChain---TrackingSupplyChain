## Requirement 1: writeup 

I used draw.io for making UML Diagrams

## Requirement 2: writeup
I have used a library called Roles which made it easier to use AccessControl in my dencentalize App. It made it easy to remove and add roles in my AccessControl contracts(FarmerRole.sol, DistributorRole.sol, RetailerRole.sol, and ConsumerRole.sol).

## Requirement 3: writeup
I did not use IPFS to deliver website.However, I could have just added my files to IPFS in order to fully decentralize my DAPP.
